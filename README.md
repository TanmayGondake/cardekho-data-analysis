 # cardekho-data-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power Bi)
**Project Objective:**

The objective of the **CarDekho Data Analysis project** is to analyze automotive sales and customer data to uncover key insights that can drive business decisions. By leveraging data analysis techniques, the project aims to identify trends in car purchases, customer preferences, and regional market performance. The goal is to provide actionable insights into sales performance, inventory management, and marketing strategies, ultimately helping CarDekho optimize its offerings, enhance customer experience, and improve overall business outcomes.


## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/TanmayGondake/cardekho-data-analysis/blob/main/cardekho_data.csv">CarDekho Data</a>


## **Questions**

   - Which car models generate the highest total revenue based on their selling price?
   - How many cars of each model were sold in different years?
   - What is the highest number of kilometers driven for each car model?
   - How many cars belong to each fuel type (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric)?
   - What is the proportion of cars sold by private sellers compared to dealers?
   - What is the price range for cars by their manufacturing year?
   - How do car prices vary by make, model, and year?


## **Process**


- Import the dataset into Power BI and clean the data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring consistency (e.g., checking for outliers in "Kms_Driven" and standardizing fuel types).

- Apply appropriate aggregations using **SUM** for total selling price, **COUNT** for car counts, and **MAX** for the highest kilometers driven, grouped by relevant columns like "Car_Name", "Year", "Fuel_Type", and "Seller_Type".

- Create relevant visualizations such as **bar charts**, **pie charts**, and **line charts** to represent the sum of selling prices by car model, car count by year, max kilometers driven, and distribution by fuel type and seller type.

- Analyze the generated visuals to identify trends, such as popular car models, sales patterns over the years, fuel type distribution, and seller performance, helping inform business decisions.
